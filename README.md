# Starting a Rails 5 API

## Get started!

To start your new Rails app, run the following command:
```
rails new rails-girls --api
```

Rails will create all the files you need, and install any necessary gems (dependencies).
```
Bundle complete! 9 Gemfile dependencies, 53 gems now installed.
Use `bundle info [gemname]` to see where a bundled gem is installed.
         run  bundle exec spring binstub --all
* bin/rake: spring inserted
* bin/rails: spring inserted
```

## Your first Rails model

Scaffold your first model and its corresponding controller and routes:
```
bin/rails generate scaffold Neighbourhood name:string num_businesses:integer home_price:decimal
```

Rails will create a database migration, a model file for Neighbourhood, tests for the model,
new routes for neighbourhoods, a neighbourhoods controller, and tests for the controller.
```
      invoke  active_record
      create    db/migrate/20181101224205_create_neighbourhoods.rb
      create    app/models/neighbourhood.rb
      invoke    test_unit
      create      test/models/neighbourhood_test.rb
      create      test/fixtures/neighbourhoods.yml
      invoke  resource_route
       route    resources :neighbourhoods
      invoke  scaffold_controller
      create    app/controllers/neighbourhoods_controller.rb
      invoke    test_unit
      create      test/controllers/neighbourhoods_controller_test.rb
```

## Add a neighbourhoods table to the database

Let's look at the new database migration generated by Rails:
```ruby
class CreateNeighbourhoods < ActiveRecord::Migration[5.2]
  def change
    create_table :neighbourhoods do |t|
      t.string :name
      t.integer :num_businesses
      t.decimal :home_price

      t.timestamps
    end
  end
end
```

You'll need to run the data migration:
```
bin/rails db:migrate
```

Rails will create the Neighbourhoods table in the database.
```
== 20181101224205 CreateNeighbourhoods: migrating =============================
-- create_table(:neighbourhoods)
   -> 0.0023s
== 20181101224205 CreateNeighbourhoods: migrated (0.0024s) ====================
```

## Putting data into the database

Rails has a console to interact with the models in your app:
```
bin/rails console
```

Looking at our Neighbourhood model, its table contains no data (yet):
```
Loading development environment (Rails 5.2.1)
:001 > Neighbourhood.count
   (1.1ms)  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "neighbourhoods"
 => 0
```

Let's add our first neighbourhood!
```
:002 > Neighbourhood.create(name: "West Humber-Clairville", num_businesses: 2463, home_price: 317508)
   (0.1ms)  begin transaction
  Neighbourhood Create (0.8ms)  INSERT INTO "neighbourhoods" ("name", "num_businesses", "home_price", "created_at", "updated_at") VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?)  [["name", "West Humber-Clairville"], ["num_businesses", 2463], ["home_price", 317508.0], ["created_at", "2018-11-01 23:05:38.953750"], ["updated_at", "2018-11-01 23:05:38.953750"]]
   (1.4ms)  commit transaction
 => #<Neighbourhood id: 1, name: "West Humber-Clairville", num_businesses: 2463, home_price: #<BigDecimal:7fa998bf24f0,'0.317508E6',9(27)>, created_at: "2018-11-01 23:05:38", updated_at: "2018-11-01 23:05:38">
```

And let's add a second neighbourhood for good measure:
```
:003 > Neighbourhood.create(name: "Mount Olive-Silverstone-Jamestown", num_businesses: 271, home_price: 251119)
```

Now our table has two neighbourhoods!
```
:004 > Neighbourhood.count
Neighbourhood Load (0.3ms)  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "neighbourhoods"
 => 2
```

Exit the Rails console.
```
:005 > exit
```

## But how do I get to the data?

Let's look at the routes Rails has created for our Neighbourhood model:
```
bin/rails routes
```

```
                   Prefix Verb   URI Pattern                                   Controller#Action
           neighbourhoods GET    /neighbourhoods(.:format)                     neighbourhoods#index
                          POST   /neighbourhoods(.:format)                     neighbourhoods#create
            neighbourhood GET    /neighbourhoods/:id(.:format)                 neighbourhoods#show
                          PATCH  /neighbourhoods/:id(.:format)                 neighbourhoods#update
                          PUT    /neighbourhoods/:id(.:format)                 neighbourhoods#update
                          DELETE /neighbourhoods/:id(.:format)                 neighbourhoods#destroy
```

To see a listing of all our neighbourhoods, we can send an HTTP GET request to
the `/neighbourhoods` URI in our app.

But first, we need to start up our server:
```
bin/rails server
```

```
=> Booting Puma
=> Rails 5.2.1 application starting in development
=> Run `rails server -h` for more startup options
Puma starting in single mode...
* Version 3.12.0 (ruby 2.3.7-p456), codename: Llamas in Pajamas
* Min threads: 5, max threads: 5
* Environment: development
* Listening on tcp://0.0.0.0:3000
Use Ctrl-C to stop
```

Our Rails server is now running on port 3000 in our local machine. Let's visit the neigbourhoods#index
controller action our browser by navigating to http://localhost:3000/neighbourhoods.

We can see our two neighbourhoods' data in [JSON] format!
```json
[
  {
    "id":1,
    "name":"West Humber-Clairville",
    "num_businesses":2463,
    "home_price":"317508.0",
    "created_at":"2018-11-01T23:05:38.953Z",
    "updated_at":"2018-11-01T23:05:38.953Z"
  },
  {
    "id":2,
    "name":"Mount Olive-Silverstone-Jamestown",
    "num_businesses":271,
    "home_price":"251119.0",
    "created_at":"2018-11-01T23:09:13.291Z",
    "updated_at":"2018-11-01T23:09:13.291Z"
  }
]
```

### What's Rails doing?

In the Rails server logs, we can see that the browser sent a GET request to the "/neighbourhoods" route:
```
Started GET "/neighbourhoods" for 127.0.0.1 at 2018-11-10 09:52:55 -0800
```

The request went to the `#index` method in our NeighbourhoodsController. The `#index` method retrieved all
the neighbourhoods from our database:
```
Processing by NeighbourhoodsController#index as HTML
  Neighbourhood Load (0.3ms)  SELECT "neighbourhoods".* FROM "neighbourhoods"
  â†³ app/controllers/neighbourhoods_controller.rb:8
```

And then the router returned the data payload in a 200 OK response back to the browser:
```
Completed 200 OK in 49ms (Views: 37.4ms | ActiveRecord: 1.2ms)
```

Congratulations! You have created and accessed your first API endpoint in Rails! ðŸŽ‰

To exit the Rails server, press Ctrl-C.
```
